## what's the icon?

it's supposed to be a [clipper](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=clipper+boat&t=ffab&iax=images&ia=images). you know, boats.  it's not super great.  i would love it if someone would help with some [great icons](https://www.electron.build/icons)!

clipper... clipster.  _the clipster clipperâ„¢_.

## but but but it uses electron, doesn't that make it heavy?

yes.  yes it does.  until someone can furnish something as easy & fast for native UIs with a largely automated build/publish platform, electron is king, as chubby as it is.
